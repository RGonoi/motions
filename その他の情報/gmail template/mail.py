text_message = f"""Dear the organizers of {tournament_name}. Thanks
Hello, we are UTDS, University of Tokyo Debate Society from Japan.
We are now collecting the motions of various English debate competitions all over the world.
We are collecting the motions on our official UTDS website, so that everyone can see the motion and practice english debate.
We would like to know the motions of {tournament_name} held in {year}, but we couldn't find it by using google search and facebook search.
Would you mind telling us the URL of motion tabs of the {tournament_name} in {year}? If URL is not available, would you mind
sending us how can we get the motion of {tournament_name}?
It would be very helpful for us. Thank you.

Best wishes,

University of Tokyo Debate Society, Student member {yourname}
