Asian BP
	ABP 2021
		R1
			This House, as a financially comfortable citizen in an East Asian society, would pursue 'warabel'
				"Warabel" describes the phenomenon of balancing individual pursuits (e.g. spending time with family and socializing with friends) and work even at the expense of increased salaries and career opportunities.
		R2
			Assuming empathy could be accurately measured, this House would restrict voting to individuals with a high level of empathy for those outside of their immediate circle
		R3
			This House believes that the queer community should oppose the glorification of white gender-fluid icons (e.g. Harry Styles, Ruby Rose, Troye Sivan, Nico Tortorella, Sam Smith, etc.)
				A person who identifies as gender-fluid has a gender identity and presentation that varies over time. A gender-fluid person may identify as male, female, agender, or any other nonbinary identity or combination of identities. Gender fluidity does not affect sexual preference or orientation.
		R4
			This House believes that South Asian states should actively prioritize forming stronger regional alliances with each other (e.g. by forming closer intra-state defense ties, increasing economic integration etc.) over forming ties with non-regional allies
		R5
			This House believes that states should aggressively invest in gaming technology and e-sports
				Gaming technology includes but is not limited to cloud gaming, mobile gaming, and Virtual Reality (VR) / Augmented Reality (AR) gaming. E-sports include but are not limited to First-Person Shooter games, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games, and Battle Royale games.

			This House regrets the commercialization of counterculture art
				A counterculture is a culture whose values and norms of behavior differ substantially from or oppose those of mainstream society
		R7
			In cases where a public official is accused of corruption, this House would lower the evidentiary standard to “balance of probability” instead of “beyond reasonable doubt”
				The "balance of probability" standard means that a court is satisfied an event occurred - if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely (probable) than not. "Beyond reasonable doubt" is a higher standard of proof that requires convincing the court that based on the evidence, there is no reason to doubt that the accused is guilty.
		R8
			This House believes that it is justified for an individual to prioritise their own self-interest over alleviating universal suffering
		Double-Octofinals
			This House believes that political opposition parties should focus their electoral campaigns on portraying the voting base of the incumbent party as reasonable and rational, rather than portraying them as being systematically manipulated through undemocratic means (e.g. disinformation on social media, historical revisionism, paid troll farms, etc.)
		Octofinals
			This House prefers a world where religions adopted the concept of "God's light"
				For the purpose of this debate, "God's light" refers to the concept where God bestows a believer with faith and/or sense of religiosity. Non-believers are seen as people who were simply not bestowed with faith, rather than individuals who actively or passively strayed from faith.
		QF
			This House regrets the dominant narrative that increasing automation and the future of labor are irreconcilable.
				The future of labor refers to demand, employment and the conditions of employment
		SF
			This House regrets the use of the imagery of the "Abused Goddess" in campaigning for women's rights in India
				The "Abused Goddess" ad campaign, created by the Save Our Sisters (SOS) women’s empowerment initiative, presented images of the three primary goddesses of Hindu mythology – Durga, the goddess of valour, Saraswati, the goddess of learning, and Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, in their silks, jewels and crowns but with welts, bruises and gashes
		GF
			This House prefers to live as a person who adopted the "closed off" model
				The "closed off" model refers to a way of life where individuals are more protective of themselves, do not express their emotions much and tend to not give away personal details about themselves. The "openness" model refers to a way of life where individuals freely express their emotions, tend to share personal information with acquaintances and friends (even if not close) and are more emotionally vulnerable.

		EFL Semi Final

		EFL Grand Final
			This House would allow the use of Nepenthes
				For the purpose of this debate, "Nepenthes" is a technology which allows individuals to irreversibly erase all sadness and sorrow, associated with past and future memories. The technology does not erase memories themselves.
	ABP 2020
		R1
			THBT historically discriminated groups should abandon narratives of historical redress in their campaign for equality.

		R2
			THBT the Democratic Party leadership should publicly commit to using 'procedurally activist' congressional tactics to pursue their policy objectives.
				The United States Democratic Party leadership constitutes the Democratic Party's Congressional Leaders and the Democratic Party's Presidential and Vice-Presidential Nominees. 'Procedurally activist' congressional tactics include but are not limited to court-packing, strategically using or abolishing the filibuster, adding states, using impeachment to delay senate judicial confirmation proceedings, and overriding executive orders.
		R3
			THW grant the WHO, in times of crisis, coercive powers to gather information about suspected infectious disease outbreaks and to enforce its policy recommendations.
				Coercive powers include the power to levy economic and financial sanctions and to stage interventions. These interventions could constitute sending information-gathering teams (which are analogous to weapons inspectors that enforce nuclear non-proliferation and anti-chemical weapons treaties) and medical teams to reinforce public health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) makes a wide variety of policy recommendations during epidemics and pandemics regarding disease outbreak reporting, travel and trade restrictions, and lockdown measures.
		R4
			THBT investors should be required to invest a significant proportion of their portfolios in the real economy.
				The real economy concerns the production, purchase and flow of goods and services (like oil, bread and labour) within an economy. It is contrasted with the financial economy, which concerns the aspects of the economy that deal purely in transactions of fiat money and other financial assets, which represent ownership or claims to ownership of real sector goods and services.
		R5
			THBT Southeast Asian nations should actively move towards the consolidation of a regional alliance at the expense of seeking stronger ties with non-regional allies (e.g. by forming closer intra-ASEAN defence ties, increasing ASEAN economic integration etc).

			This House Regrets the Goldwater rule
				The Goldwater rule is a law in the United States that states it is unethical for mental health professionals to give a professional opinion about public figures they have not examined in person and from whom they have not obtained consent. Thus, it opens them for libel if they give a public psychiatric competence analysis on non consenting public figures

Currently, the technology has been proven successful in growing baby sheep.

			This house believes that Islamic authorities in South East Asia should issue a fatwa denouncing Wahhabism
				In the Islamic faith, a fatwa is a non-binding but authoritative legal opinion or learned interpretation issued by a qualified religious leader, pertaining to Islamic law and ethics. Followers are expected to adhere to these rulings. Wahhabism is an Islamic doctrine and religious movement that is often described as ultraconservative and puritan. It aims to restore what its believers consider to be the only correct and pure form of Islam. Saudi Arabia politically and financially supports Wahhabism around the world.

Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine, NATO agreed to forward deploy four multinational battalion battle groups to NATO members most at risk of a possible Russian attack – specifically Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty enshrines the principle of collective defence, where an armed attack against one member state must be deemed to be an armed attack against all member states.
