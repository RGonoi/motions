North-East Asian Debate Championship
	Tokyo NEADC 2021
		Round 1
			Assuming feasibility, this house would pass all major legislation through direct referendum.
		Round 2
			This house supports dating apps that are exclusive to members of particular ethnic communities (e.g. AsianDating.com, WhereWhitePeopleMeet, etc.)
		Round 3
			This house believes that post-colonial nations should prioritise narratives of religion over quantitative outcomes when attempting to implement reconstruction policy.
		Round 4
			This House Believes That all countries should impose a carbon import tax
				A "carbon import tax" applies domestic carbon taxes to the carbon emissions of an imported good. For instance, a bicycle made in Vietnam but imported to Cambodia would have to pay the same amount in carbon taxes to the Cambodian government as would have to be paid if that bicycle was produced in Cambodia.
		Round 5
			This House Believes That the insanity defence should extend to people with serious ASPD
				Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the interests of others. People with serious ASPD are commonly known as psychopaths or sociopaths.
				The application of the insanity defence means that the perpetrator is not punished; rather, they are referred to psychiatric care and released as soon as it is deemed to be safe.
		Round 6
			This House Believes That diasporas should actively seek a connection with their ancestral heritage
		Octofinals
			TH, as the United States of America, would heavily prioritise countries under significant Chinese influence in the Build Back Better World project (e.g. Cambodia, Laos, and Pakistan)

		Quarterfinals
			THP a world where Asia and Europe had a single common electrical grid
				"An electrical grid is an interconnected network for electricity delivery from producers to consumers. Electrical grids vary in size and can cover whole countries or continents.
				A common electrical grid allows electricity to flow between different countries with no restrictions or tariffs."
		Semifinals
			THP a world in which individuals were judged upon their death based on the standards of their religion, and were punished or rewarded accordingly (e.g. heaven and hell, reincarnation, afterlife, etc.), as opposed to one in which there is no afterlife, though individuals remain unsure of that fact.
		Grand Final
			THW require all marriages to stipulate specific expectations and obligations of spouses
		EFL Quarterfinals
			This House Believes that Western tech companies should enter into authoritarian markets even at the expense of conforming to local laws and regulations
		EFL Semifinals
			This House Opposes the practice of Tatemae
				Honne" refers to a person's true feelings and desires, and "Tatemae" refers contrastingly to the behaviour and opinions one displays in public. In Japan, the rules around Tatemae are meant to minimise discord, and failing to observe Tatemae might be seen as insulting or aggressive. In many cases, Tatemae leads to outright telling of lies in order to avoid exposing the true inward feelings.
		EFL Finals
			THW deprioritise unvaccinated inidividuals from state medical services if they are infected with severe cases of COVID-19
